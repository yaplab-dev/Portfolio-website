I'm developing this website to showcase an artistic intervention from two nationally recognised artists as part of a wider colaborative project to resignify public spaces. 
Currently working on the implementation of Tailwind framework for responsiveness and fine-tuning javascript animations. Expected to grow for displaying other actions from the same project.
